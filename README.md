This is our final engineering project for the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) 12 week programing course. We wanted to create an augmented reality phone application that would allow the user to see 3D representations of the stars and planets through their phone camera, placed in their actual locations in the night sky!

## Motivation

As a fully self-directed team project, we wanted to take what everything we had learned at Makers about process and engineering principles and apply it to a project that was completely different to anything we had done before. None of us had ever worked on a mobile app, let alone augmented reality software, and we wanted to try and apply the skills we had gained over the past 10 weeks to a completely new challenge, language and tech stack!

This app was chosen from a range of possible projects for a number of reasons:
1. Genuine interest in Augmented Reality - we had wanted to do work with this and experiment with its possible applications for some time, especially after hearing about new AR apps implementing Darknet's [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
2. A desire to make something that felt tangible. Previous apps we had designed were web-based, but an AR app would allow the user to interact with their physical environment in a new way, rather than being something that exists purely online.
3. The challenge presented by working with a completely new tech stack, as well as a lower-level language than we had ever used before in [Swift](https://swift.org/). This drove us to learn _a lot_ in a very short space of time to overcome obstacles in the development process.
4. The ambitious nature of the project would mean we would have to stick to best practices and work efficiently as a team. This would be a great test of our skills in agile development, as we would need to have daily stand-ups and implement sprints and good delegation to keep the project on-track.

We organised our task list using GitHub's [Project Card Wall](https://github.com/jo-quin/stargazer/projects/1) feature and kept detailed records of our successes, failures, difficulties and learning in our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/jo-quin/stargazer/wiki).

## Installation

To download and install the app, you will need an up-to-date copy of [Xcode IDE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and an iPhone running iOS 11 or higher. If you are new to Xcode (as we were!) you can find Apple's support documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) to help you get started.


2. Clone or download the StarGazer project.

3. Open Xcode, select the StarGazer file (note you will need an apple ID and password to install the app, you can create one [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204316)).

4. Connect iPhone to your computer.
5. Run the build using the play button in Xcode
* You will need to trust the developer from your phone by following method:
  * Settings
  * General
  * Device Management
  * and trust the developer (it will be your apple ID) - this will allow you to install the app

6.  Now sit back, look around and enjoy the AR view on your iPhone! :iphone:

## Technologies used

* Xcode:
  * ARKit
  * SceneKit
  * UIKit

* iPhone running iOS 12.2 (requires iOS 11 or higher)

* [In-The-Sky](https://in-the-sky.org/location.php)

* Language(s):
  * Swift

## Improvements / Status

## Using StarGazer

* Open the app, you will see a view from your camera with AR planets and stars
* Touch the screen on a planet or star to find out more information
